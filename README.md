## High Performance Computing

Directories `cpu-slo` and `cpu-opt` contain revisions of our CPU code. Directories `gpu-slo` and `gpu-opt` contain revisions of our GPU code.

Directory `gap` contains the [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) code for the benchmarks we used.

Subdirectories of `times` contain benchmark results for each implementation.

`presentation.pdf` is our slide deck, and also contains tabular benchmark results.
